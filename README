This will take a screenshot of your screen(s) with your desired interval.

How to install:
0. Install imagemagick ("brew install imagemagick" will put it in /usr/local, if you have it elsewhere, edit the path to montage in screenshot_timer.sh)
1. Edit screenshot_timer.sh to set the path to dump the images in.
2. Edit com.sanfred.screenshot_timer.plist (with vim or Property List Editor) and set your interval and the correct path to screenshot_timer.sh.
3. Put com.sanfred.screenshot_timer.plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents
4. If you don't feel like rebooting, run "launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sanfred.screenshot_timer.plist"

To stop the script and still have it start next boot, run "launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sanfred.screenshot_timer.plist"
To stop it from starting when you log in, remove ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sanfred.screenshot_timer.plist
